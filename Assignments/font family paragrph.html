    <h1> A mobile phone (or cellphone[a]) is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency
        link while the user is moving within a telephone service area, as opposed to a fixed-location phone (landline
        phone)</h1>
    <h2>A mobile phone (or cellphone[a]) is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency

    <h3> Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture and therefore mobile telephones are called
        cellphones (or "cell phones") in North America</h3>
    <h4>n addition to telephony, digital mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging,
        multimedia messagIng, email, Internet access (via LTE, 5G NR or Wi-Fi), short-range wireless communications
        (infrared, Bluetooth), satellite access (navigation, messaging connectivity), business applications, video games
        and digital photography. </h4>

    <p>WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and
        Microsoft), is the only alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of
        plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being discontinued, as browsers are dropping plug-in support).
        Prior to its adoption, there was asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus strictly works in all browsers),
        that's also used as a compiler target with efficient support in browsers such as Internet Explorer 11; and for
        such browsers that do not support WebAssembly directly, it can be compiled to asm.js and those browsers
        supported that way. Generally speaking programmers do not program in WebAssembly (or asm.js) directly, but use
        languages such as Rust, C or C++ or in theory any language, that compile to it.</p>
