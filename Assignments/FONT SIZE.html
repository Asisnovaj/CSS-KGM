        represented Italy in international football since its first match in 1910. The national team is controlled by
        the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), the governing body for football in Italy, which is a co-founder and
        member of UEFA. Italy's home matches are played at various stadiums throughout Italy, and its primary training
        ground and technical headquarters, Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano, is located in Florence. Italy are the
